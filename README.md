# wos Crazy Joe

on Joe lvl 11  1.68M of 1.8M max with 6 squads

## heroes in city and HQ:
- strongest defender heroes are used (only one player heroes matter, all 3 heroes, all skills)
- attack boosting heroes works the best (if you are the strongest one)
- other defender heroes skills seems to be ignored (thanks Theo for "seems")
- points do not depend on own hero type


## troops in city:
- troop lvl, type and count matters (stats other than mentioned above seems to be ignored)
- as long as there is enough infantry, other types score 0 (marksman score as last)
- you want as many own infantry and as many city owner marksman as possible
- if you do not have enough infantry, use lancers to reinforce


## troops in hq
- troop lvl, type and count matters (stats other than mentioned above seems to be ignored)
- as long as there is enough infantry, other types score 0 (hq1, low Joe lvl hq2)
 - if so, just use 10:0:0 ratio

- "it's complicated" when joe is stronger than infantry
 - if it a bit stronger, you want lancers too
 - if it is crazy stronger, you want marksman too
- if people send different ratios, point distribution goes crazy
- you want others to send type that is not 100% used, so your troop type score the best, team spirit suffer this way
- if all try to use ratio that works the best for you, points are not fair and HQ overall score may suffer in higher joe lvl (less joe kills, less points to share)
- if all use same ratio, points are fair (high troop lvl gets more), proper ratio can be used in high joe lvl


###Tests:
 - perfectly the same troops in same city at the same time, different garrison hero type - same points
 - different strongest defender heroes, not joe killed in final waves with blue heroes
 - different troops level of same type and count, kills proportional to troop power, points proportional to kills
